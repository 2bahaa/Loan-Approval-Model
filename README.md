# Loan Approval Prediction Model

A comprehensive machine learning project for predicting loan approval decisions based on applicant financial and personal information. This project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflow including exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation with a focus on handling imbalanced datasets.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Financial institutions need automated systems to evaluate loan applications efficiently and consistently. This project builds a binary classification model to predict whether a loan application will be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on various applicant features.

### Key Features
- **Multi-method feature selection** using 4 different techniques
- **Class imbalance handling** with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- **Comprehensive model comparison** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- **Extensive data visualization** with 16+ analytical plots
- **Business-focused evaluation** with confusion matrix analysis

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains loan application records with the following features:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Core Libraries
```python
pandas              # Data manipulation and analysis
numpy               # Numerical computing
matplotlib          # Data visualization
seaborn             # Statistical data visualization

```

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear probabilistic classifier
- **Decision Tree**: Non-linear rule-based classifier
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with multiple decision trees

## 🔍 Feature Selection Methods

The project implements 4 different feature selection techniques:

1. **Random Forest Feature Importance**: Tree-based feature importance
2. **Mutual Information**: Measures statistical dependence
3. **ANOVA F-test**: Statistical significance testing
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Linear relationship strength

Features are ranked using a **combined scoring system** that normalizes and averages all methods for robust selection.

## 📈 Data Analysis & Visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Target variable distribution analysis
- Statistical summaries for all features
- Missing value assessment
- Class imbalance detection

### Visualization Suite (16+ plots)
- **Distribution plots**: Pie charts, histograms, box plots
- **Relationship analysis**: Scatter plots, cross-tabulations
- **Feature comparison**: Box plots by loan status
- **Correlation analysis**: Heatmaps for numerical features
- **Asset analysis**: Comparative asset value plots

## 🎯 Model Performance Evaluation

### Metrics Used
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy
- **Precision**: Of predicted approvals, how many were correct
- **Recall**: Of actual approvals, how many were predicted
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under the ROC curve
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed error analysis

### Business Impact Analysis
- **False Positives**: Approved bad loans (costly for lenders)
- **False Negatives**: Rejected good loans (lost opportunities)
